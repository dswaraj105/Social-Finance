What are stocks? What are shares?\r\n      </Typography>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <Typography variant=\"body1\">\r\n        Imagine you started a new company or business of selling apple juice.\r\n        You start selling the apple juice and now you want to expand your juice\r\n        brand by opening another outlet or let’s say increasing the production\r\n        of your juice to sell more. You can invest slowly by what you profit\r\n        from your business and invest it in expanding your company. Another way\r\n        of expanding your business is taking loans from bank. Another way of\r\n        expanding is , the company you formed , you divide the company into\r\n        let’s say 30 parts. Then you sell these parts of business or company to\r\n        people in marketplace. The marketplace for selling and buying of these\r\n        companies part is called Stock market. Parts of a company are called\r\n        Shares. A collection of shares is called stocks.\r\n      </Typography>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <Typography variant=\"body1\">\r\n        But how can you divide a company? It sounds confusing to you? A company\r\n        issue paper (shares) , recognised by SEBI – Securities & Exchange board\r\n        of India , a body which recognises and regulate the stock market of\r\n        India. Your company is illegitimate, if you don’t register in SEBI. Only\r\n        if you register in SEBI, you can issue shares.\r\n      </Typography>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <Typography variant=\"body1\">\r\n        A company divide itself into various parts via these papers called\r\n        shares. If I divide my company into 30 parts , that means that I have\r\n        divided the company in 30 shares. Now I can sell let’s say 10 shares in\r\n        marketplace to those who would like to buy these shares. I sold my\r\n        shares at 1 shares = 20 Rupees. Total amount of money that I would have\r\n        if I would sell all my shares in the marketplace at a share price of 20\r\n        would be 600 rupees. This 600 rupees is called market valuation or\r\n        capitalisation of company. A stock or shares price determined the value\r\n        or capitalisation of a company. So when you hear somebody says Apple is\r\n        the most valuable company in the world or Saudi Aramco is the most\r\n        valuable company in the world, they are actually saying that their total\r\n        amount of rupees of shares are equal to worth the most money in the\r\n        marketplace.\r\n      </Typography>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <Typography variant=\"body1\">\r\n        A company which issue shares is often called promoter. Promoters can\r\n        issue as many shares as they can and divide their company in as many\r\n        parts as they want. When initially for the first time, any company issue\r\n        shares to general public to buy and sell , its termed as IPO , initial\r\n        public offering.\r\n      </Typography>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <Typography variant=\"body1\">\r\n        People who buy shares are called shareholders. Being a shareholder gives\r\n        the shareholders voting power. Shareholders, along with promoters ,\r\n        constitute what is called as Board of directors of an company. If the\r\n        Shareholder total holding in the company is more than 50 % then they can\r\n        overturn any decisions that the promoter takes. Because being\r\n        shareholder means being the owner of the company but in per cent or\r\n        partially, not wholly.\r\n      </Typography>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <Typography variant=\"body1\">\r\n        A marketplace where selling and buying of these shares and stocks happen\r\n        is called Stock market. By law, every company is required to publish its\r\n        “ Annual report” which includes all about company sales , profit made or\r\n        loss made, revenue generation , etc. It contains all the facts and\r\n        figures of a company. If the company grows good or shows the promise of\r\n        growth , the share price increases. If the company goes into loss or\r\n        shows poor growth promises , the share price decreases. Its simple\r\n        demand and supply principle which we would talk about later as to why\r\n        this happens.\r\n      </Typography>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <Typography variant=\"body1\">\r\n        In India, NSE – National Stock Exchange and BSE – Bombay Stock Exchange\r\n        are two of the most popular stock markets. There is a third stock\r\n        exchange MSEI i.e. Metropolitan Stock Exchange of India (earlier known\r\n        as MCX-SX), however, the same is less popular as compared to the other 2\r\n        exchanges.\r\n      </Typography>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <Typography variant=\"body1\">\r\n        Lots of selling and buying take place in these stock markets. According\r\n        to a company valuation , it is classified in stock market as small-cap ,\r\n        mid –cap and large cap. The meaning is obvious, small cap means\r\n        companies whose market capitalisation is small. Medium cap whose market\r\n        capitalisation is medium in stock market and large cap meaning whose\r\n        market capitalisation is large in stock market.\r\n      </Typography>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <Typography variant=\"body1\">\r\n        Market capitalisation means in simple terms that what is the price of\r\n        all the stocks of a company. For example 600 Rupees is the market\r\n        valuation and capitalisation of my company in stock market. It is\r\n        important to note that since the share price keeps fluctuating, the\r\n        market cap of a company keeps changing too.\r\n      </Typography>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <Typography variant=\"body1\">\r\n        The following table demonstrates large –cap, mid –cap and small –cap as\r\n        per their market capitalisation\r\n      </Typography>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <Typography variant=\"body1\">\r\n        <Grid container spacing={5} className={cssClasses.gridContainer} >\r\n          <Grid item sm={4} className={cssClasses.border} >\r\n            Large-cap companies\r\n          </Grid>\r\n          <Grid item sm={4} className={cssClasses.border}>\r\n            Mid-cap companies\r\n          </Grid>\r\n          <Grid item sm={4} className={cssClasses.border}>\r\n            Small-cap companies\r\n          </Grid>\r\n          <Grid item sm={4} className={cssClasses.border}>\r\n            Market Capitalisation above Rs. 20,000 Crore.\r\n          </Grid>\r\n          <Grid item sm={4} className={cssClasses.border}>\r\n            Market capitalisation in between Rs. 5,000 – 20,000 Crore.\r\n          </Grid>\r\n          <Grid item sm={4} className={cssClasses.border}>\r\n            Market Capitalisation below Rs. 5,000Crore.\r\n          </Grid>\r\n        </Grid>\r\n      </Typography>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <Typography variant=\"body1\">\r\n        There are two terms that are called Nifty 50 (or simply NIFTY) and\r\n        Sensex.
