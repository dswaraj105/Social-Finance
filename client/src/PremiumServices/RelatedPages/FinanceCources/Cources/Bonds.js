        Bonds are different from stocks. Bonds are relatively safer and less
        risky. They can be used as an asset for an investor to provide semi
        -yearly or yearly or quarterly cash flow (depend on the bonds).

        Bond is simply a loan taken out by a company. Instead of going to a
        bank, the company gets the money from investors who buy its bonds. In
        exchange for the capital, the company pays an interest coupon—the annual
        interest rate paid on a bond.

        Bonds are financial instruments which are relatively a Safe bet for an
        investor to invest in. Bonds are issued by an company , Non-Banking
        finance institutions , Banking institutions and also government
        institutions.

        Here is the logic, let’s assume that government wants to raise funds to
        develop a hospital in a town. The government needs funds for that
        hospital,, but the government does not have the funds for creating a
        hospital. So what government can do is they can issue bonds, which can
        be bought by investors. The government sell the bonds at a price say 1
        bond for 10 rupees. The government issue as many bonds as they want , to
        fulfil the need of the money requirement. Now here is how the bonds
        works.

      <Typography variant="body1">
        Bonds have a maturity date. What that means is bonds have a fixed tenure
        and with fixed interest rates and after those tenure ends, you will get
        your principal amount back along with interest. Maturity date is the
        date when the principal or par amount of the bond is paid to investors
        and the company’s or issuer of bond obligation ends.

        As the promoter here is government, the risk involved in these
        investments is negligible. You are guaranteed to get your money back,
        that too with interest rates. But these interest rates are not as high
        as compare to money you can earn by investing in stock market value
        investing. So many argue that while bonds are safe, they don’t provide
        much returns to investors. While some Investors use bonds to maintain
        liquidity( cash in hand) and whenever they see an investment opportunity
        in different investment avenues, they use these bonds to invest in that.
        Bonds are a good financial instruments to have liquidity.

      <br />
      <Typography variant="body1">
        When you invest in Bonds, you will get your money back at an interest
        rate. This interest rate is set when you invest in bonds. The bonds are
        purchased by investors who are interested in earning a fixed interest in
        a fixed tenure. After you have purchased the bonds , its interest rate
        cannot change and its tenure cannot change. Changing interest rates of
        bonds by the promoters changes its price structure. Let’s see how that
        happens.
      </Typography>
      <br />
      <Typography variant="body1">
        Bonds have an inverse relationship to interest rates. For example
        imagine you buy a bond for 10 rupees at 2 % interest rate for a period
        of 2 years. After 6 months, the promoters issue new bonds which give
        interest rate of 4 % on the bonds that you were holding. If you have to
        sell your bonds in the open market, then you have to lower your price.
        That’s because why would anyone want to buy a 2% interest rate bond over
        4 % interest rate bonds. If you plan to hold the bond until the end of
        the its time period , then selling bonds is really not your concern and
        you don’t need to take much concern in it.

        A bond can be secured or unsecured. A secured bond pledges specific
        assets to bondholders if the company cannot repay the obligation. This
        asset is also called collateral on the loan. So if the bond issuer
        defaults, the asset is then transferred to the investor..
      </Typography>
      <br />
      <Typography variant="body1">
        Unsecured bonds, on the other hand, are not backed by any collateral.
        That means the interest and principal are only guaranteed by the issuing
        company. Also called debentures, these bonds return little of your
        investment if the company fails. ﻿ As such, they are much riskier than
        secured bonds.

        If the issue of bonds is not by the government but by a company , first
        check out that company financial health before investing in their bonds.
        When buying bonds , there is a risk of issuer defaulting on their
        commitment due to various reasons like they ran out of funds, the
        company is performing poorly and cannot repay its debt, etc. When you
        buy bonds , you take on this risk of default. So if you are buying bonds
        from Non-government sources, keep a eye on how is the issuer doing and
        what financial health is issuer in.

        Some government bonds may provide you opportunity to earn money tax
        –free. You can keep a lookout on such bonds as not only these bonds
        safe, but also by being tax free, it increases your rate of returns from
        the investment.

        There is another risk associated with bonds. It is called prepayment
        risk. Prepayment risk is the risk that a given bond issue will be paid
        off earlier than expected, normally through a call provision. With a
        call provision added to the bond, the corporation can pay the debt off
        early. When buying bonds see if this call provision is there or not.

        Consider a bond that is issued by a company or government for Rs. 100
        with a coupon of 7% for a period of five years. This implies that every
        year , the issuer will pay interest of 7% while the principal will be
        refunded after the bond matures. What drives the bond market is the fact
        that bondholders are free to sell their bonds before maturity.

        The face value of a bond is what it sold for initially. Since they are
        transferable through sales in the bond market , their value fluctuates .
        The returns accured by holders is measured by the yield, which is the
        rate of interest paid as coupons.
      </Typography>
      <br />
      <Typography variant="body1">
        Yield is calculated as the coupon divided by the value of the bond. It
        is multiplied by 100 to be expressed in percentage. In effect, yield =
        (coupon/value) *100
      </Typography>
      <br />
      <Typography variant="body1">Yield= CouponValue × 100</Typography>
      <br />
      <Typography variant="body1">
        In the example above, if the face value of the bond fell to Rs.80, the
        yield would rise to 8.75%, that is (7/80*100). Correspondilgy , if the
        value rose to Rs. 120 , the yield would drop to 5.83%, that is
        (7/120*100).
      </Typography>
      <br />
      <Typography variant="body1">
        It should be noted that even if the value of a bond fluctuates , the
        amount that can be redeemed after the term of maturity is reached is the
        face value, which is Rs.100 in this case. Bond yield is inversely
        proportional to its current value. The greater the yield, the lower the
        current market price of the bond.

        Conventional metrics used by economist to diagnose the health of a
        country economy include inflation, repo rate of central banks, growth
        rate and national income . However , bond yields are also the means of
        analysing economy in a indirect way. As investors sell Government bonds,
        price drop, ad yield increases. A higher yield indicates greater risk.
        If the yield offered by a bond is much higher than what it was when
        issued, there is a chance that the company or government that issued it
        is financially stressed and may not be able to repay the capital .

        Government bonds are relatively more stable, but low demand at auctions
        indicate low investor confidence in the country economy.
